                It's been more than 4 years i have been working on software development. Have developed various kind
                of project with complex reporting system, have experience in web scraping, API Development and so

                If you are in need of someone who is not just a programmer but also need to have vision, plan, top
                notch communication or any kind of long term assistance on a project, then I'm the perfect candidate
                for you. Let's discuss your project requirements, I'll find an efficient way to get it done. I want
                to work on a project which will be consistent at any point of project development phase, not
                something which looks cool at first, gets uglier by time what you might have experience in past.
